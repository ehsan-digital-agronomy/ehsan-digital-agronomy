# Hi, I'm Ehsan

PhD Candidate in Digital Agronomy | University of Manitoba  
Graduating: Summer 2026  

I work at the intersection of remote sensing, machine learning, and precision agriculture, developing practical tools for crop nutrient management and yield prediction.

## Research & Technical Focus
- UAV multispectral and LiDAR (3D canopy structure) analytics
- Hyperspectral spectroscopy (VNIR–SWIR spectroradiometer) for nutrient assessment
- Satellite-based crop monitoring
- Machine learning for nitrogen status and yield prediction
- Field-scale spatial analysis and decision support

## Experience
- Mitacs-supported applied research projects
- Field experiments and data collection in Manitoba
- Collaboration with agricultural stakeholders

## Technical Skills
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Geospatial analysis (Rasterio, GeoPandas, GDAL)
- Remote sensing workflows (UAV & satellite)
- LiDAR-derived canopy metrics and feature engineering
- Machine learning (Random Forest, Neural Networks)
- Data visualization and spatial analytics

## Portfolio (Industry-oriented projects)
Work in progress:
- UAV vegetation index processing pipeline
- Nitrogen status classification and management zones
- Yield prediction using machine learning
- Time-series crop monitoring
- Field management zone delineation

## Career Interests
AgTech | Precision Agriculture | Industrial R&D | Government Research (AAFC)

Location: Manitoba, Canada
